Don't worry, there is no complicated ``Socket`` programming; all thing is simple to understand.  

-You must also UDP port open; select item in comboBox on NAT page of Modem: TCP and UDP (both) , otherwise you can't hear live microphone.  

For Keylogger your victim must toggle on Accessibility button of your trojan in Settings of Device
